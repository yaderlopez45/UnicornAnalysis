creation and valuation**\n\n## **Goal**\nAnalyze how the top three industries performed over time by showing how many unicorns each industry produced in 2019, 2020, and 2021, and comparing their average valuations in billions of dollars.\n\n## **Method**\nThe top three industries are selected based on total unicorn creation across the full period. The yearly results are filtered to include only these industries and only the years 2019 to 2021. The number of new unicorns is counted for each industry and year, and the average valuation of those companies is converted into billions for easier comparison. The results are ordered by year so that changes can be observed over time.\n\n## **Result**\nAcross the three-year period, the strongest industry by volume is:\n- Fintech with a peak of 138 new unicorns in 2021 and an average valuation of about 2.75 billion dollars\n\nInternet software and services shows consistent high growth with:\n- 119 new unicorns in 2021 and valuations around 2.15 billion dollars\n\nE-commerce and direct-to-consumer has fewer total unicorns but higher valuations, including:\n- 47 new unicorns in 2021 and an average valuation of about 2.47 billion dollars\n\nThe results show that 2021 was the breakout year for all three industries. Fintech led in both scale and investment intensity, supported by rapid digital adoption. Internet software followed a stable upward path through all three years. E-commerce grew sharply in 2021 but showed the highest valuations in earlier years, indicating deeper capital deployment during the earlier pandemic cycle.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ec47f86f-86da-4f30-98b6-601177bbc0ec"},{"source":"WITH top_industries AS (\n\tSelect \n\t\ti.industry as industry, \n\t\tEXTRACT(YEAR FROM
